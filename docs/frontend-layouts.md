# Frontend layouts

A generated frontend's **app-shell layout** — the arrangement of navigation,
content, and panels — is selectable with `--layout` (CLI), `frontend.layout`
(YAML), or the interactive prompt. Every layout is fully responsive
(desktop / tablet / mobile) and is built by composing forge's reusable
Layer-1/Layer-2 components (see [Layered components](../README.md#layered-components-vue-3)).

> **Scope.** All six layouts ship for **Vue 3, Svelte 5, and Flutter**, and every
> `(framework, layout)` builds in its generated container — Vue/Svelte via
> `npm run build`, Flutter via `flutter build web` (the Flutter image runs
> `dart run build_runner` for the freezed / riverpod / json codegen before
> building). Selecting an unavailable `(framework, layout)` pair fails config
> validation with the list of layouts available for that framework.

## The layouts

| Slug | Name | Regions | Best for |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| `sidebar` | Sidebar App Shell *(default)* | left nav rail + top bar + main (+ optional right panel) | Enterprise SaaS, admin, internal tools |
| `topnav` | Top-Nav Content Shell | top menu bar + centered main + footer | Marketing, e-commerce, content sites |
| `tabbar` | Tab Bar App Shell | bottom tab bar → nav rail → sidebar (promotes by width) | Touch-first / consumer apps, PWAs |
| `threepane` | Three-Pane + Right Agent Panel | left nav + center + persistent right agent-chat / artifacts (or inspector) | AI apps & collaborative tools |
| `bento` | Bento Grid Dashboard | header + asymmetric grid of variable-size tiles | SaaS homepages, dashboards |
| `docs` | Documentation 3-Column | left doc-tree + content + right TOC | Developer docs, knowledge bases |

`sidebar` is the **byte-parity baseline**: it is the frontend forge produced
before layouts existed, so selecting it (or omitting `--layout`) reproduces
the previous output exactly.

### Responsive contract

Every layout implements three breakpoint tiers off one shared source
(`useBreakpoint`): **mobile `<600px` · tablet `600–840px` · desktop `≥840px`**.
Each layout owns its per-tier reflow, e.g. `tabbar` promotes its bottom tab bar
to a nav rail then a full sidebar; `docs` hides its TOC on tablet and moves its
tree into a drawer on mobile.

## Usage

```bash
# CLI flag
forge --project-name shop --backend-language python --features products \
  --frontend vue --layout topnav --yes

# YAML config
#   frontend:
#     framework: vue
#     layout: threepane
forge --config forge.yaml --yes

# Interactive: after choosing a framework you're prompted for a layout
# (only shown when the framework offers more than one).
```

The choice is persisted in the project's `forge.toml` (`[forge.frontend].layout`)
so `forge update` and harvest round-trips preserve it.

## Architecture

Two orthogonal concerns:

- **Dispatch** — *which* shell renders. A layout is the entire shell skeleton,
  so it maps to a Copier **template variant** selected by a
  `(framework, layout)` registry, **not** an option/fragment. (Fragments are
  additive injections, and `plan_validator`'s file-overlap check forbids
  several fragments writing the same shell file — a structural dead end for
  whole-shell selection.)
- **Composition** — *how* each shell is built: from reusable **Layer-2** region
  components (`AppHeader`, `SidebarNav`, `BottomTabBar`, `RightPanel`,
  `TocPanel`, `BentoGrid`, …) built from **Layer-1** basics. A layout is a thin
  Layer-3 arrangement of regions; nothing is re-implemented per layout.

The shared, layout-invariant scaffolding (router, auth, API client, the
Layer-1/2 component library, codegen landing paths) lives in the **base**
template (`templates/apps/vue-frontend-template`). A non-default layout is a
**two-stage render**: forge renders the base first, then overlays the layout's
thin variant template (its `MainLayout.vue` + any layout-specific regions). This
was validated byte-identical to a single render. `sidebar` is self-contained
(single render) and needs no overlay.

`frontend_layout` is threaded through `variable_mapper → answers.json →
post_generate`, so the chat-off MainLayout replacement applies only to
`sidebar`; other layouts gate their chat with `{% if include_chat %}` and
degrade cleanly when chat is disabled.

## Adding a layout

Adding a layout is a **drop-in** — no changes to `generator.py`:

1. Create `forge/templates/layouts/<framework>/<slug>/layout.toml`:
   ```toml
   [layout]
   name = "<slug>"
   framework = "vue"
   display_label = "My Layout"
   template_dir = "layouts/vue/<slug>"   # relative to forge/templates
   base = "apps/vue-frontend-template"    # "" for a self-contained variant
   supported = true
   ```
2. Add the thin overlay under `template_dir/template/` — at minimum
   `src/shared/layouts/MainLayout.vue.jinja` composing base components, plus any
   new Layer-2 region components. Copy the base's `copier.yml` into the variant
   dir. Use `.vue.jinja` so `{% if include_chat %}` and `{{ app_title }}` render;
   wrap Vue mustaches in `{% raw %}…{% endraw %}`. Preserve the
   `// --- feature nav items ---` / `// --- end feature nav items ---` markers in
   any nav you render so the feature injector can splice generated routes.

The layout is auto-discovered on the next run; `forge --frontend <fw> --layout
<slug>` and the interactive picker pick it up automatically.

**Plugins** register layouts at runtime instead of shipping a manifest:

```python
def register(api):
    api.require_sdk(">=1.3")
    api.add_frontend_layout(
        "vue", "mylayout", "/abs/path/to/template", "My Layout",
        base_template_dir="apps/vue-frontend-template",
    )
```
