# Architecture decision records

Records of significant architectural decisions in forge. Each ADR
captures the context, the decision, the alternatives that were
considered and rejected, and the consequences we accepted.

New ADRs follow the format of the existing files: Status, Context,
Decision, Alternatives considered, Consequences, References.
Numbering is sequential; gaps are kept for cancelled or withdrawn
proposals.
