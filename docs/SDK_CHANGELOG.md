# Plugin SDK Changelog

This file tracks changes to the **plugin SDK surface** — the names and
signatures listed in ``forge/api.py``'s ``__all__``. The SDK version
lives at ``forge.api.SDK_VERSION`` and is independent of the forge
package version: a forge package release that doesn't touch the API
surface leaves SDK_VERSION unchanged.

Plugin authors target the SDK via ``api.require_sdk(">=X.Y")`` at the
top of their ``register()`` function. Bumps to SDK_VERSION require a
matching entry below; ``tests/test_sdk_version.py::test_sdk_changelog_exists``
asserts this file is present, and PRs that mutate ``forge.api.__all__``
without an entry fail review.

Versions follow ``MAJOR.MINOR`` only — no patch component, no
pre-release labels. SDK MAJOR aligns with the plugin compat boundary
(plugins may need code changes); MINOR signals additive surface
(plugins keep working, can opt into new APIs).

## 1.2 (2026-05, with forge 1.2.0-alpha.x)

Status: **provisional** — the new surfaces are additive but the
contracts may grow in a 1.3 minor before promotion to stable.

Added:

- ``ForgeAPI.add_injector(suffix: str, injector: Injector)`` —
  Pillar A.1, pluggable per-suffix injector dispatch. Replaces the
  hardcoded ``if/elif`` suffix chain in
  ``forge/appliers/injection.py:_dispatch_injector`` with a module-
  level registry at ``forge/injectors/_registry.py``. Built-ins
  (``.py`` / ``.pyi`` → LibCST, TS family → regex/ts-morph, ``*`` →
  sentinel text) seed at import time; plugins register new file
  types via ``add_injector``. Unblocks polyglot backend plugins that
  want to ship ``.go`` / ``.kt`` / ``.rs`` AST injectors without
  forking forge.

  The ``Injector`` contract is the same positional signature every
  existing injector exposes:
  ``(file: Path, feature_key: str, marker: str, snippet: str,
  position: str) -> None``. Provisional in 1.2 — the callable may
  grow a return value (e.g. structured diff for telemetry) in a
  later minor; the positional signature is locked.

- ``ForgeAPI.add_hook(hook: PhaseHook)`` — Pillar A.3, register a
  :class:`forge.hooks.PhaseHook` to observe generator phases.
  Callbacks (``on_phase_start`` / ``on_phase_end`` /
  ``on_generate_complete``) fire from the existing
  :func:`forge.logging.phase_timer` contexts that already wrap every
  phase, so no plumbing change is required to add new observability
  surfaces. Use cases: telemetry sinks, SBOM emitters, supply-chain
  signers, post-``forge new`` shell scripts. Hook exceptions are
  swallowed + logged inside the fire helpers so a buggy plugin
  cannot crash generation.

- ``forge.hooks`` module — the ``PhaseHook`` protocol itself,
  ``register_hook`` for direct in-tree callers, and the testing
  helper ``reset_hooks_for_tests``. ``forge.plugins.reset_for_tests``
  already calls the latter so test suites using the existing plugin
  reset fixture get hook isolation for free.

## 1.1 (2026-04, with forge 1.1.0-alpha.x)

Status: **stable**.

Added:

- ``ForgeAPI.require_sdk(spec: str)`` — plugin SDK version negotiation.
  Plugins call this at the top of ``register()`` to fail fast on an
  incompatible host instead of crashing with a confusing
  ``AttributeError`` when reaching for a method the host doesn't
  ship. ``spec`` is a comma-separated list of clauses
  (``">=1.1"``, ``">=1.1, <2.0"``).
- ``forge.api.SDK_VERSION`` — the version constant itself, exposed for
  plugins that want to introspect rather than constrain.
- ``ForgeAPI.add_service(capability: str, template: ServiceTemplate)``
  — register a docker-compose service keyed by capability. (Lifted
  from 1.1.0-alpha.1 release notes; the surface change is captured
  here as the first SDK_CHANGELOG entry.)

Changed:

- ``forge.fragments`` is now a namespace package (was the legacy
  monolithic ``forge/fragments.py``). All previously-public names
  (``Fragment``, ``FragmentImplSpec``, ``FRAGMENT_REGISTRY``,
  ``register_fragment``, etc.) are re-exported from the package
  root, so plugin imports of the form ``from forge.fragments import
  X`` keep working unchanged.
- ``forge.config`` is similarly a namespace package now. Same
  re-export contract — every name plugins consumed (``BackendLanguage``,
  ``ProjectConfig``, ``BACKEND_REGISTRY``, ``register_backend_language``,
  etc.) is exposed at the package root.

## 1.0 (2026-Q1, with forge 1.0.0a1 → 1.1.0-alpha.0)

Initial public SDK surface. Captures the names that landed across the
1.0.0 alpha series — recorded retroactively here so future bumps have
a baseline to diff against.

Public names:

- ``ForgeAPI`` (since 1.0.0a1)
- ``ForgeAPI.add_option`` (since 1.0.0a1)
- ``ForgeAPI.add_fragment`` (since 1.0.0a1)
- ``ForgeAPI.add_backend`` (since 1.0.0a2)
- ``ForgeAPI.add_frontend`` (since 1.0.0a4)
- ``ForgeAPI.add_command`` (since 1.0.0a4)
- ``ForgeAPI.add_emitter`` (since 1.0.0a1, **provisional**)
- ``PluginRegistration`` (since 1.0.0a1)
