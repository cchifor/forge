# Platform overview

Forge has two roles: a Python CLI that composes projects, and the application
source it generates. The generated project owns its deployment and runs without
the Forge CLI in the request path. Forge is used again to inspect, validate,
extend, and upgrade that source.

## What the platform provides

| Area | Checked-in capability | Main extension point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Services | Python/FastAPI, Node/Fastify, Rust/Axum; CRUD entities, tests, migrations, Dockerfiles | Application composition and public ports |
| Frontends | Vue, Svelte, Flutter; selectable shells, API clients, optional chat | Application pages/components and public shared runtime |
| Platform topology | Monolithic, microservices, headless API, multitenant SaaS presets | Backend list, application templates, declared dependencies |
| Data | PostgreSQL; schema-driven entities and shared types; optional tenancy | Entity schemas and repository/service contracts |
| Auth | Gatekeeper/Keycloak stack, verifier SDKs, service delegation, BFF sessions | Supported auth provider and scope/tenant configuration |
| AI and tools | Optional LLM, agent, RAG, MCP, and canvas features | LLM/vector/tool ports and feature registry |
| Reliability and operations | Optional queues, caching, telemetry, rate limits, health, object storage | Options and backend-specific adapters |
| Lifecycle | Provenance, ownership, regeneration, conflict proposals, coverage gates | Reviewed generator/schema/plugin changes |

Features vary by backend and frontend. Consult the [live option
catalog](../FEATURES.md), [support limits](../reference/limitations.md), and
the resolved plan; the table does not promise that every combination exists.

## System context

```

The same command surface serves manual and agent workflows. An agent skill
provides instructions; it does not bypass configuration validation, source
ownership, or CI. Selecting `agent.mode` configures an application's runtime AI
features and is a separate concern from using a coding agent to operate Forge.

## Generated runtime

This diagram shows a Gatekeeper-backed multi-service shape. Application requests run directly from the edge to services with public APIs. A minimal project omits components it did
not select; a headless project has no frontend.

```mermaid

    Browser[Browser] --> Edge[Traefik]
    Edge --> UI[Vue / Svelte / Flutter]

    GK --> IdP[Keycloak or configured identity provider]
    GK --> Redis[Redis sessions and tenant routes]

    Ports --> LLM[LLM provider]
    Ports --> Vector[Vector store]
    Ports --> Queue[Queue adapter / workers]
    Ports --> Tools[MCP tools / object storage / webhooks]
```

`services/<name>/` contains each backend, `apps/<frontend>/` the selected client,
and `infra/` deployment/auth material. Shared runtime may live in `packages/`
or `sdks/`, depending on the selected feature. Each backend builds its own image;
Compose connects the images and supporting services. Optional Helm output is
topology-aware; it still requires environment-specific deployment configuration.

The built-in multi-service presets use Python application templates. The core
generator also supports mixed-language backends; changing a preset's language
requires a compatible application template and options. A language badge is not
a guarantee that every specialized template has an equivalent implementation.

## Service boundaries and routing

The edge routes requests to application APIs by host/path. Each service owns its
business behavior, authorization, API contract and domain data. A backend for
frontend (BFF) is optional application code tailored to a particular client;
aggregation is one possible responsibility. Gatekeeper's browser session/token
management is separate from that client-specific API behavior.

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Edge / ingress | Route public APIs, terminate TLS when configured, invoke ForwardAuth on authenticated routes. |
| Gatekeeper | Verify browser sessions or optional API keys, issue internal JWTs and S2S tokens. |
| Domain service | Verify accepted credentials; enforce scopes, tenant/resource ownership and business rules. Call dependencies directly. |
| Optional application BFF | Implement a client-specific API using the same authenticated service-call contracts. |

Select service boundaries for distinct business capabilities, ownership,
independent deployment or scaling needs. Multiple CRUD processes alone do not
establish those properties. A modular single-service application is a reasonable
starting point; split it when the benefits justify distributed failure modes.

The generated Compose stack is for development: it publishes backend host ports,
routes every backend through Traefik, uses an application-wide bridge network,
and shares a PostgreSQL administrator credential. The production reference model
exposes only deliberately public APIs; internal services remain private. A shared
PostgreSQL cluster is acceptable with separate service-owned databases and
restricted runtime roles. The template does not establish those production
boundaries automatically. See [deployment](../operations/deployment.md).

## Direct service-to-service communication

A calling service obtains a short-lived token from Gatekeeper, then calls its
dependency directly. Gatekeeper is the credential issuer, not the data path for
that request. `depends_on` plus `auth.service_discovery=true` generates permitted
targets, credentials and internal URLs; business calls still belong in application
code.

Use client credentials for an autonomous machine operation with an explicitly
authorized tenant. Use token exchange for a user-delegated operation: retain the
user's subject and tenant, record the calling service as actor, and intersect
permissions. Delegation must be allowed by the registry and receiving policy.
The requested service target (`svc-inventory`) is distinct from the current
platform-wide JWT audience (`forge-services`); receiving services must enforce
service-specific permissions. See [S2S communication](../guides/service-to-service.md).

## Optional third-party API access

`auth.api_keys=true` enables Gatekeeper's API-key management and `X-API-Key`
authentication. It requires generated Gatekeeper authentication and defaults to
false. An administrator issues a tenant-bound key with explicit scopes and an
expiry; Gatekeeper stores its hash and forwards a signed internal identity to the
public API. The service enforces feature permissions and resource ownership.

API keys identify an integration, not the administrator who created it. They
cannot be used as user-delegation subjects. Enabling the option does not generate
application permission rules or expose administrative endpoints publicly.
See [API keys](../guides/api-keys.md) for issuance, use, revocation and deployment.

## Browser request and authentication flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Browser
    participant Edge as Traefik
    participant GK as Gatekeeper
    participant IdP as Keycloak
    participant Store as Redis
    participant API as Backend verifier
    User->>Browser: Sign in
    Browser->>GK: Login through edge route
    GK->>IdP: OIDC authorization flow
    IdP-->>GK: Verified identity and tokens
    GK->>Store: Store encrypted tokens and session TTL keys
    GK-->>Browser: Opaque session cookie
    Browser->>Edge: API request with cookie
    Edge->>GK: ForwardAuth session check
    GK->>Store: Check validity without extending idle TTL
    GK-->>Edge: Internal ES256 token
    Edge->>API: Forward request with token
    API->>API: Verify signature, issuer, audience, scopes
    API-->>Browser: Application response through edge
```

Gatekeeper is the sole internal token authority for this configuration.
Backends verify its tokens; they do not directly accept the upstream Keycloak
token. Python ships the baseline `forge_core` verifier integration and the optional
`platform_auth` SDK; Node and Rust use their emitted platform-auth SDKs. Explicit user activity refreshes the
idle session through `/auth/session`; background API traffic does not extend it.
See the [auth contract](../auth-architecture.md) for two-key Redis TTL behavior,
JWKS caching, session timeout, and on-behalf-of token exchange.

When service discovery is enabled, backend `depends_on` edges produce registry
grants and internal URLs. A service obtains a scoped token from Gatekeeper before
calling an allowed peer. This is generated configuration, not automatic discovery
of arbitrary services at runtime. Development service secrets are deterministic
and must be replaced for deployment.

## Tenant data isolation

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Claim[Verified tenant claim] --> Middleware[Tenant middleware]
    Middleware --> Transaction[Transaction-local tenant setting]
    Transaction --> RLS[PostgreSQL row-level security]
    RLS --> Rows[Rows for the current tenant]
    Missing[Missing tenant context] --> Empty[Empty scope / no tenant rows]
    TMS[Tenant-management control plane] --> Provision[Realms and tenant routes]
```

The `multitenant-saas` preset uses `database.multitenancy=shared_rls` and
`database.tenant_resolution=token_claim`. The app binds the verified tenant to
`app.current_tenant` for the transaction. The tenant-management service is exempt
from the application RLS fragment and uses its separate control-plane model.
PostgreSQL superusers and BYPASSRLS roles bypass RLS; table owners also bypass
it unless FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY applies. The development `postgres` runtime
credential must be replaced by restricted roles. This pattern requires the
correct policies and transaction boundaries; validate tenant-isolation journeys for the deployment you operate.

## AI, retrieval, and asynchronous work

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UI[Chat client] --> Agent[Backend agent endpoint]
    Agent --> History[Conversation persistence]
    Agent --> LLM[LLM provider port]
    Agent --> Registry[Tool registry]
    Registry --> MCP[MCP tools]
    Agent --> Retrieve[Retrieval pipeline]
    Retrieve --> Embed[Embedding provider]
    Retrieve --> Vector[Vector-store port]
    Input[Documents or background work] --> Queue[Queue port / adapter]
    Queue --> Worker[Worker]
    Worker --> Vector
    Agent --> Events[AG-UI events / canvas payloads]
    Events --> UI
```

This is the optional rich feature path, primarily supported by the Python
backend. Schema-generated UI events and canvas contracts keep client/backend
types aligned. It is distinct from autonomous coding-agent orchestration:
`agent.mode=multi_agent` is registered but rejected as unimplemented.
For notifications and other jobs, the queue backend supplies transport;
application logic still needs idempotency, bounded retries, delivery policy,
and failure handling. See [technology selection](../guides/technology-selection.md).

## Generation and upgrade boundary

Reusable runtime, shared SDKs, and schema outputs are protected generated code.
Business behavior belongs in editable application scaffolds and custom modules
registered through public ports. [Generator internals](generator.md) explains
how these pieces are emitted; [customization](../guides/customization.md) and
[quality gates](../operations/generated-code-quality.md) explain how to evolve
them without losing the ability to regenerate.
