"""Kubernetes/Helm deployment fragments.

``deploy.target=kubernetes`` realises a single fragment:

  ``deploy_helm_chart`` — a TOPOLOGY-AWARE Helm umbrella chart at
  ``<project>/deploy/helm/``. Project-scoped and language-agnostic. Its
  ``values.yaml`` is rendered at generate/update time from the project's
  deployment topology (:func:`forge.config._topology.compute_topology`,
  exposed to the fragment as the ``topology`` Jinja variable), producing one
  ``workloads`` entry per backend plus the frontend and platform-service
  toggles. The chart's ``templates/*.yaml`` are pure Go-templates copied
  verbatim — they ``range`` over ``.Values.workloads`` and resolve at
  ``helm install`` time.

Raw per-backend k8s manifests are no longer hand-authored: ``deploy/k8s/`` is
derived on demand from the chart (``helm template`` — see the generated
``Makefile``), so the manifests can never drift from the chart.
