# src/app/gatekeeper/authz.py
"""Pure role-authorization primitives for the Gatekeeper.

This module deliberately imports **only the standard library** (no fastapi,
redis, weld, or opentelemetry) so it stays importable and unit-testable in
isolation — it holds the security-critical decision logic for the admin gate
in front of the ``/api/v1/api-keys`` lifecycle endpoints.

The two functions are pure (no I/O, no framework objects):

* :func:`extract_realm_roles` defensively pulls the Keycloak
  ``realm_access.roles`` list out of a verified access-token payload.
* :func:`is_authorized` answers "does this role set satisfy the required
  role" with an exact, case-sensitive string match.

Both fail closed: a malformed or missing claim yields an empty role list,
and an empty role list never satisfies a requirement.
