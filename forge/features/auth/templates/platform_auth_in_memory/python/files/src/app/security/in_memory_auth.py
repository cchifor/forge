"""Wire the in-process dev issuer into the application's auth guard.

The ``in_memory`` auth provider ships this installer in place of the
Gatekeeper sidecar. :func:`install_in_memory_auth` is injected into the
application factory at ``FORGE:APP_POST_CONFIGURE`` — i.e. *before*
``AppLifecycle.bootstrap`` runs — so it can:

1. construct the single process-wide :class:`InMemoryIssuer` and stash it on
   ``app.state`` for the ``/dev/auth/*`` routes to reach, and
2. redirect ``AppLifecycle.bootstrap``'s ``build_auth_guard(...)`` call to the
   in-memory variant, so the guard that ends up on ``app.state`` verifies the
   exact tokens this issuer mints — no Gatekeeper, no Keycloak, no network.

The redirect is a deliberate, narrow rebinding of the ``build_auth_guard``
symbol that ``app.core.lifecycle`` imported at module load. It is the seam
that lets the issuer-agnostic SDK + middleware (shipped by
``auth.mode=generate``) stay byte-identical while only the *issuer* changes.
