/**
 * Centralised RBAC capability checks for the UI surface — a derived layer over
 * ``useAuth().hasRole``.
 *
 * Why a capability layer rather than scattering ``hasRole('admin')`` at call
 * sites: call-sites express *intent* (``canDelete``) not *role*, so when the
 * backend later splits ``admin`` into granular roles you rewire only here; and
 * the UI can *hide* affordances a user can't exercise (instead of showing them
 * and erroring on submit). The UI is a convenience gate, not the security
 * boundary — the backend still authorizes every request.
 *
 * Roles (see ``useAuth`` ``AuthUser.roles``): ``admin`` (full read/write incl.
 * destructive), ``user`` (read + non-destructive write — the default member
 * role), ``viewer`` (read-only; reserved so gates degrade gracefully when it
 * lands). Each capability is a *function*, not a ref, so call-sites re-evaluate
 * on every render; ``useAuth`` is a module singleton so the underlying ref is
 * stable.
 *
 * These are deliberately generic verbs — extend the interface with your
 * domain's capabilities (``canDeleteOrder``, …) mapping each to the role
 * predicate it requires.
