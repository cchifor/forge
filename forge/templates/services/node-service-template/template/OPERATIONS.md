# Operations runbook

Operator-facing notes for running this Node/Fastify service in production.
See `OBSERVABILITY.md` for tracing, metrics, and logging.

## Configuration order

Settings load lowest-to-highest priority (later wins):

1. Zod schema defaults (in code).
2. `config/defaults.yaml`.
3. `config/{ENV}.yaml` — selected by `ENV` (or `NODE_ENV`), default `development`.
4. `.secrets.yaml` — gitignored local overrides.
5. `APP__*` environment variables — nested with `__`, e.g.
   `APP__DB__URL`, `APP__SERVER__PORT`. Values are coerced (`"true"` → boolean,
   `"123"` → number) before Zod validation.

**Env vars always win.** Config is validated by Zod at startup; a malformed
value fails fast with the offending path.

### Production auth guard

If `security.auth.enabled=true` in a production-like environment (anything other
than `development`/`test`/`local`), the loader **throws at startup** unless
`GATEKEEPER_ISSUER` and `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` are both set. This prevents shipping
an auth-on service with no issuer configured.

## Database migrations

Migrations run automatically on container start via `entrypoint.sh`:

```sh
npx prisma migrate deploy   # then: node dist/index.js
```

`prisma migrate deploy` is idempotent and safe under concurrent replica boots —
replicas that lose the race apply nothing. To run out-of-band, execute the same
command against the target `DATABASE_URL` before starting the app.

## Graceful shutdown

`SIGTERM` (rollout) and `SIGINT` (Ctrl-C) trigger a guarded shutdown: the
handler calls `app.close()`, so Fastify stops accepting new connections, drains
in-flight requests, and runs `onClose` hooks before the process exits. A
`shuttingDown` flag makes a second signal a no-op. Set the container termination
grace period to comfortably exceed your slowest request.

## Health checks

The service exposes liveness/readiness endpoints under `/api/v1/health/`
(`/live`, `/ready`). Wire `/live` to the liveness probe and `/ready` to the
readiness probe so traffic only routes once dependencies are reachable.
