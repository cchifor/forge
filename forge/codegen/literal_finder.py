"""Detect literal-value edits between two snippet bodies.

Used by :class:`forge.extractors.injection.InjectionExtractor` to decide
whether a user's edit to a fragment-emitted block is a *pure literal swap*
(promotable to a new Option) or a *structural change* (which stays
``needs-review``).

For Python: :mod:`libcst` parse + parallel tree walk. The two trees must
have the same structure — same node types, same positions, same non-literal
leaves; only literal-leaf differences are collected as :class:`LiteralEdit`
records.

For TypeScript: routed through :mod:`forge.injectors.ts_morph_sidecar`
when ``FORGE_TS_AST=1``; otherwise returns ``()`` (no literal edits
detectable; caller treats the diff as structural).

For Rust: out of scope for v1. Returns ``()``.

Used downstream by the harvester to:

1. Emit a ``safe-apply`` candidate for the underlying block (instead of
   downgrading to ``needs-review`` for any non-empty diff).
2. Emit an *option-promotion suggestion* — a side-car patch file proposing
   that the changed literal be promoted to a typed :class:`forge.options.Option`
   so the same setting flows through to sibling language impls.
