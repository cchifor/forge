"""Baseline re-stamping — the main accept_harvested orchestrator + per-kind handlers.

Split out from the original ``accept.py`` god module — see
:mod:`forge.sync.project_to_forge.accept` for the public surface.

The Story B round-trip closes here. The forward flow is:

    1. User runs ``forge --harvest`` → bundle on disk.
    2. User (or a maintainer) lands the candidate patches upstream
       (``forge --emit-pr`` or by hand).
    3. The forge maintainer reviews + merges.
    4. The user pulls the new forge release.
    5. The user runs ``forge --accept-harvested <bundle>``.

Step 5 — this module — re-stamps the project's ``forge.toml`` so the
user's edits become the new baseline. Without it, every subsequent
``forge --verify`` would re-classify the user's blocks as
``user-modified`` against the now-upstream fragment baseline and
``forge --update`` would emit ``.forge-merge`` sidecars complaining the
user "drifted" from what is now their own contributed snippet.

The contract is intentionally narrow: we only re-stamp records the
bundle covered, and only when we can verify the upstream fragment has
actually been updated to match the user's edit (i.e. the round-trip
actually completed). Bundles that were generated but not yet landed
upstream surface as ``skipped-not-applied`` — running
``--accept-harvested`` is then a no-op rather than a silent baseline
shift.

This module is read-only against the bundle (the on-disk
``manifest.json`` layout produced by :mod:`forge.sync.project_to_forge.bundle`
is the input contract); the only thing it writes is the project's own
``forge.toml`` via :func:`forge.sync.manifest.write_forge_toml` (which
preserves schema v2 invariants — template_versions etc.).

    """Re-stamp the project's ``forge.toml`` after a harvest bundle landed upstream.

    Reads ``<bundle_path>/manifest.json`` (the layout
    :func:`forge.sync.project_to_forge.bundle.write_bundle` produces),
    walks each candidate, and for those whose risk is in ``risk_filter``:

    * **Block candidates** — locate the project file, read the current
      block body via :func:`forge.injectors.sentinels._read_block_body`,
      compare against the bundle's recorded ``current_sha`` and the
      upstream fragment's rendered snippet. When the upstream snippet
      matches the user's body, the bundle has landed → re-stamp the
      manifest's ``merge_blocks`` entry's ``sha256`` (and bump the
      ``fragment_version`` from the registry when available). Otherwise
      surface as ``skipped-not-applied``.
    * **Files candidates** — re-compute the project file's SHA. If the
      fragment-shipped file (under ``<fragment_dir>/files/<rel>``) now
      hashes to the same value, the bundle has landed → re-stamp the
      manifest's ``provenance`` entry. Otherwise ``skipped-not-applied``.
    * **deps / env candidates** — emitted as ``skipped-not-applied``
      with the rationale that structural manifest reasoning hasn't been
      wired yet (matches :func:`apply_bundle_to_fragments`'s deferral).
    * **new-file candidates** — re-stamp the manifest's ``provenance``
      entry to mark the file as fragment-owned now that upstream ships it.

    Args:
        project_root: Project the bundle was extracted from. Must
            contain a ``forge.toml`` — missing / malformed manifest
            surfaces as a bundle-level error (``report.errors``
            non-empty).
        bundle_path: Directory containing the bundle ``manifest.json``.
            Per :class:`HarvestBundle.write`'s layout.
        risk_filter: Subset of the candidate-risk vocabulary the accept
            step considers. Defaults to ``("safe-apply",)`` — the
            auto-acceptable tier. Pass
            ``("safe-apply", "needs-review")`` to accept needs-review
            candidates as well.
        quiet: When ``False``, prints a one-line per-candidate progress
            note. Tests should pass ``True``.

    Returns:
        An :class:`AcceptHarvestedReport` carrying per-entry dispositions
        and aggregate counters. The CLI dispatcher maps a non-empty
        :attr:`AcceptHarvestedReport.errors` to a non-zero exit code
        (5 — the manifest-IO code).

    Never raises on individual candidate failures — those land as
    ``error`` entries. Only bundle-level failures (missing
    ``manifest.json``, unreadable ``forge.toml``) populate
    :attr:`AcceptHarvestedReport.errors`.
