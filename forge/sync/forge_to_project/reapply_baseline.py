"""``forge --reapply-baseline`` — discard user edits to fragment-owned records.

Resets fragment-emitted files / blocks to their current fragment content.
Equivalent to ``forge --update --mode overwrite`` but scoped to the
records that are currently classified ``user-modified`` against the
``forge.toml`` baselines.

Per-record behavior:

* For each ``[forge.provenance]`` entry with ``origin == "fragment"``
  AND :func:`classify` returning ``user-modified``: overwrite the file
  with the fragment's current shipped content and re-stamp
  ``[forge.provenance][...].sha256`` / ``emitted_at``.
* For each ``[forge.merge_blocks]`` entry whose body sha differs from
  the recorded baseline: re-render the fragment's ``inject.yaml``
  snippet, write it into the file via
  :func:`forge.injectors.sentinels._inject_snippet`, and re-stamp the
  block's ``sha256``.
* ``origin="user"`` records are never touched.
* ``origin="base-template"`` records flow through ``copier update`` —
  they're a separate concern; reapply-baseline leaves them alone.
* ``sentinel-corrupt`` blocks surface an ``error`` entry — the operator
  must repair the sentinels manually before reapply can act.
* Records referencing a fragment no longer in
  :data:`forge.fragments.FRAGMENT_REGISTRY` surface an ``error`` entry
  and the on-disk file is left untouched.

The contract is intentionally narrow: this verb is the "escape hatch"
when a user has experimented locally and wants to throw away the
experiment without re-generating the project. It is NOT the same as
``--update``: it does not run the resolver, does not consider
``copier`` answers, and does not touch base-template files.

    ``scope`` filters which kinds run. Accepts any subset of
