"""Interactive walk of ``.forge-merge`` sidecars produced by ``forge --update``.

Phase 2 follow-up: the canonical "after-conflict" workflow. ``forge
--update`` (forward apply) produces ``.forge-merge`` / ``.forge-merge.bin``
sidecars for every record whose three-way decide returned ``conflict``
— the target file is preserved verbatim, the new content the fragment
wanted to emit goes next to it.

Before this verb existed, the operator had to manually:

  1. Walk every sidecar (``find . -name '*.forge-merge*'``).
  2. Diff the sidecar against the target.
  3. Pick a resolution: accept (overwrite target), reject (delete
     sidecar), or hand-merge.
  4. Re-stamp ``forge.toml`` so the resolved body becomes the new
     baseline (otherwise ``forge --verify`` keeps flagging drift and
     ``forge --update`` keeps re-emitting the same sidecar).

``forge --resolve`` automates the whole walk. The substrate (sidecar
format, the merge primitives in :mod:`forge.sync.merge`, the manifest
re-stamp helpers in :mod:`forge.sync.project_to_forge.accept`) all
exist; this module wires them into one TUI flow.

Algorithm:

  1. Discover every ``.forge-merge`` / ``.forge-merge.bin`` sidecar
     under the project root (``Path.rglob``).
  2. Sort deterministically by POSIX path so the same project yields
     the same prompt order.
  3. For each sidecar: parse the header tag, identify the target file,
     classify as block-level vs file-level vs binary-file, render a
     diff preview, prompt accept/reject/edit/skip/quit.
  4. Action handlers — accept replaces the target's content (block body
     for block-level, full file for file-level), reject just deletes
     the sidecar, edit drops the user into ``$EDITOR`` with a 3-way
     conflict scratch file, skip leaves both alone, quit terminates the
     loop and emits the remaining sidecars as skipped.
  5. On accept / edit, re-stamp ``forge.toml`` so the resolved body
     becomes the new manifest baseline.

This is non-destructive against the on-disk manifest until the operator
explicitly picks ``accept`` or ``edit``; a quit-mid-walk leaves
everything as it was, with un-resolved sidecars still on disk.

Tests monkeypatch :func:`forge.cli.interactive._ask_select` (and the
editor-runner :func:`_open_editor`) to drive the interactive flow
non-interactively.
