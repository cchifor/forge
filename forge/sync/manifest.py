"""Read and write the project-root ``forge.toml`` manifest.

``forge.toml`` is the source of truth for ``forge --update``: it records
which forge version generated the project, where the templates live, and
every Option value the user set. From schema v2 (1.2.0+) it also
records per-language base-template versions, per-file template/fragment
versions, and per-block emitting-fragment metadata — the substrate the
bidirectional sync flows (forward update, reverse harvest, drift verify)
all share. From schema v3 (WS2) it adds a parallel
``[forge.option_origins]`` table that records, for every persisted
option, whether the value was user-set or defaulted by the resolver —
the substrate ``forge --update`` uses to skip fragments whose backends
aren't present without erroring on options the user never asked for.
From schema v4 (Initiative #3) it adds a ``[forge.frontend]`` table
recording the frontend framework + its on-disk app directory so
``forge --update`` can target frontend-only projects (``backend.mode =
"none"``) and gate ``target_frontends`` fragments without re-deriving
the framework from disk every run.

Canonical v4 format::

    [forge]
    schema_version = 4
    version = "1.2.0"
    project_name = "acme"

    [forge.templates]
    python = "services/python-service-template"
    vue = "apps/vue-frontend-template"

    [forge.template_versions]
    python = "0.6.1"
    vue = "1.0.0"

    [forge.frontend]
    framework = "vue"
    app_dir = "apps/frontend"

    [forge.options]
    "middleware.rate_limit" = true
    "rag.backend" = "qdrant"

    [forge.option_origins]
    "middleware.rate_limit" = "user"
    "rag.backend" = "default"

    [forge.provenance."src/app/main.py"]
    origin = "base-template"
    sha256 = "abc..."
    template_name = "python-service-template"
    template_version = "0.6.1"
    emitted_at = "2026-04-21T14:33:02Z"

    [forge.merge_blocks."src/app/main.py::middleware_cors:MIDDLEWARE_REGISTRATION"]
    sha256 = "def..."
    fragment_name = "middleware_cors"
    fragment_version = "1.2.0"
    snippet_sha256 = "789..."
    line_range = [44, 46]

Schema v1 manifests (missing ``schema_version``) are accepted on read —
the new fields default to absent. The next ``forge --update`` run
upgrades the manifest in place via ``migrate_provenance_v2``.

Schema v2 manifests are accepted on read — the absent
``[forge.option_origins]`` table is synthesized as all-``"default"`` so
the resolver silently skips fragments whose backends aren't present
(instead of erroring on persisted defaults). After the next
``forge --update`` (or first re-generate) the manifest is re-stamped
to v3 with accurate origins. Other write paths (``--reapply-baseline``,
``--accept-harvested``, ``--resolve``) preserve the on-disk schema
version intentionally — they shouldn't surprise the user with an
unrelated schema bump on what may be a quick fix-up command.

Schema v3 manifests are accepted on read — the absent
``[forge.frontend]`` table is reconstructed by walking the on-disk
project for the ``apps/<slug>/`` directory and a recognisable
framework marker (Vue / Svelte / Flutter), seeded from
``[forge.templates]`` when present (the same map the generator stamps).
This keeps ``forge --update`` working on pre-v4 projects without a
manual migration step; the next re-stamp upgrades the manifest in
place.

Pre-Option shapes (legacy ``[forge.features.*]`` /
``[forge.parameters]`` tables) are rejected with a clear error pointing
to ``forge.toml`` re-generation — the refactor is a hard cutover.

    """Emit ``forge.toml`` with all v4 sub-tables.

    ``schema_version`` defaults to the current version; existing callers
    that omit it produce a v4 manifest. ``template_versions`` may be
    None or empty when the caller doesn't know per-template versions
    (legacy migration paths) — the table is omitted in that case.

    ``option_origins`` is the v3 provenance table: dotted option path
    → ``"user"`` / ``"default"``. When ``None`` (existing call sites
    that haven't been ported yet — generator, updater, resolver,
    reapply_baseline, accept), every entry in ``options`` is recorded
    as ``"user"`` to preserve current behavior (the resolver in Stage B
    will treat empty/missing origins as user-set, matching this
    fallback). Origins for paths absent from ``options`` are silently
    dropped — the two tables must stay parallel-keyed.

    ``{}`` (empty dict) and ``None`` produce identical output today:
    both result in every option being recorded as ``"user"`` because
    the per-key fallback at the merge step defaults to ``"user"`` for
    any key not in ``option_origins``. Stage B callers that need to
    express "all defaulted" must pass a fully-populated dict with
    explicit ``"default"`` values; ``{}`` is not a shortcut.

    ``merge_blocks`` stores per-block metadata used by the three-way
    merge runtime (see :mod:`forge.sync.merge`) and by the
    reverse-direction harvester (see :mod:`forge.sync.project_to_forge`
    — Phase 4).

    ``frontend`` is the v4 ``[forge.frontend]`` table — framework name
    + on-disk app dir. ``None`` or a record with empty fields omits
    the table entirely; existing call sites (``--reapply-baseline``,
    ``--accept-harvested``, ``--remove-fragment``) that don't track
    the frontend separately pass ``None`` and the read path
    re-infers from disk on the next load.
