"""Fragment + FragmentImplSpec dataclasses + parity-tier helpers.

A **Fragment** describes how to apply a named template fragment (living
under ``forge/templates/_fragments/<name>/<backend>/``) to a generated
project. Fragments are internal plumbing: users never name them
directly. Users select **Options** (``forge/options/``); each Option
enumerates the Fragments that realise each chosen value via its
``enables`` map.

Fragment layout on disk is:

    <fragment_name>/<backend_lang>/
        inject.yaml  — list of (target, marker, snippet) injections
        files/       — verbatim files to copy into the generated project
        deps.yaml    — dependencies added to pyproject/package.json/Cargo.toml
        env.yaml     — env vars appended to .env.example

All four are optional; a fragment can be pure-injection, pure-files, or
any mix. ``scope="project"`` applies once to the project root instead of
each backend's directory (use for cross-cutting files like AGENTS.md).
