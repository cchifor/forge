"""Pure, deterministic computation of the multi-service platform synthesis.

The heart of Phase 4. :func:`compute_platform_synthesis` walks the resolved
plan + the project's backends and computes a single in-memory
:class:`PlatformSynthesis` object describing the service-to-service (S2S) auth
graph: one :class:`ServiceClient` per backend (client id / deterministic
secret / audiences-with-scopes / inter-service URL) plus the shared OIDC
issuer, realm, internal audience, and event-bus wiring.

Determinism is the design constraint: no clock, no randomness, no I/O, sorted
iteration everywhere. Secrets are HMAC-derived from the project slug + backend
name so the same config always yields the same registry — reproducible across
runs (golden-stable when later rendered) and idempotent for ``forge --update``
(re-derivation reproduces the same plaintext → no secret rotation churn).

P4.1 ships the computation only; the renderers do not consume this object yet
(that is P4.2), so enabling ``auth.service_discovery`` does not change any
generated file. Note that secret *hashing* (argon2) and secret emission are a
P4.2 concern — argon2's PasswordHasher does not support a fixed salt, so this
module intentionally carries the deterministic *plaintext* only.
