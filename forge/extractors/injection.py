"""InjectionExtractor — reverse counterpart of :mod:`forge.appliers.injection`.

Where :class:`forge.appliers.injection.FragmentInjectionApplier` writes
fragment-rendered snippets between BEGIN/END sentinels in target files,
this extractor reads those same regions and harvests user edits.

Phase 4 implements block-level harvest using
:func:`forge.sync.merge.reverse_three_way_decide`. For each injection
record in :attr:`~forge.extractors.plan.ExtractionPlan.injections`, the
extractor:

1. Locates the BEGIN/END sentinel block in the on-disk target file
   under ``ctx.backend_dir / inj.target``.
2. Reads the manifest's baseline SHA for that block from
   ``ctx.merge_block_baselines`` (POSIX rel-path keyed by manifest key).
3. Compares the current body against the upstream fragment-rendered
   snippet via :func:`forge.sync.merge.reverse_three_way_decide`.
4. Emits a :class:`~forge.extractors.pipeline.CandidatePatch` of kind
   ``"block"`` per divergent block.

The trickier classification cases live here:

* Multi-line block edits — even pure-literal — are flagged
  ``"needs-review"`` when the upstream snippet contains a Jinja
  interpolation site (``{{ }}`` / ``{% %}``); the harvester can't safely
  back-port literal edits into a template that re-renders at apply time.
* **AST-level literal edits** (item 6) — when an upstream snippet is
  literal-only (no Jinja) and the user's edit is a pure literal-value
  swap (``120`` → ``60``, ``"foo"`` → ``"bar"``, ``True`` → ``False``),
  the extractor emits ``"safe-apply"`` *plus* an
  ``option_promotion`` payload of :class:`LiteralEdit` records that
  the bundle layer turns into an `option-promote` side-car patch.
  See :mod:`forge.codegen.literal_finder`.
* Missing sentinel pair — when forward provenance says a block was
  applied but the project no longer contains the markers — emits
  ``"conflict"``: the user (or another tool) stripped the markers
  and the extractor cannot anchor.
* ``no-baseline`` (v1 manifest entries without recorded sha) and
  ``skipped-*`` outcomes don't emit a candidate.

    BEGIN/END sentinels. The inject.yaml ``snippet:`` field stores the
    raw snippet — no leading indent, no forced trailing newline. To
    apply-back the user's edit cleanly, we reverse the two
    transformations the forward path applies:

    1. **Strip the leading indent** — every line that's prefixed with
       the BEGIN line's indent has the prefix removed. Lines that
       don't carry the full indent (e.g. blank lines emitted as
       ``\\n`` only) pass through unchanged.
    2. **Trim ONE trailing newline** — the forward path appends ``\\n``
       to every line, including the last. inject.yaml snippets don't
       end with a stray newline. Trimming one ``\\n`` restores the
       round-trip-able shape.

    Empty / corrupt-sentinel cases fall through to ``current_body``
    untouched.
