"""Tests for the codegen-side caches (Initiative #6).

Two caches are introduced in this initiative:

* :mod:`forge.codegen._schema_cache` — in-process, mtime-keyed JSON
  schema cache consumed by every schema loader
  (:func:`forge.codegen.ui_protocol.load_schema`,
  :func:`forge.codegen.canvas_contract.load_components`,
  transitively by ``event_union.load_event_schemas`` and
  ``canvas_props.load_canvas_schemas``).
* Content-hash skip in :func:`forge.codegen.pipeline._write` — when
  the new payload sha matches the existing on-disk file's sha, the
  write is skipped and the file's mtime is preserved.

These tests pin both the cache hit count for the schema cache (with
mtime invalidation) and the zero-write guarantee for an unchanged
codegen pass.
