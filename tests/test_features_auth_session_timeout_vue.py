"""Invariants for the Vue session-timeout fragment (Phase 8).

The fragment ships ``useSessionTimeout`` composable + ``SessionTimeoutModal``
component into the active Vue frontend tree, implementing the SPA
half of platform's BFF + session-timeout RFC verbatim. The non-trivial
design constraints — drift-immune countdown, cross-tab leader election,
visibility gating, activity debounce — must all be present in the
shipped source for the runtime to behave correctly.

Behavioural verification (the actual countdown drift, BroadcastChannel
dedup, modal open/close at warnAt) lives in the Vue unit tests and
Playwright e2e once Phase 9 lands. This file gates the *structural*
correctness of what gets shipped.
