"""Regression tests for ``run_lane_smoke``'s diagnostic dump on failure.

The bug we guard against here: when ``docker compose up`` itself
fails — e.g. a backend container exits non-zero during bring-up —
``run_lane_smoke`` used to early-return without invoking
``_dump_compose_diagnostics``, because the dump was gated on
``compose_up = True`` and that flag was only set AFTER the up-result
check. Result: the failed containers' logs (the exact data we need
to debug the failure) were never captured into ``FORGE_MATRIX_LOG_DIR``,
so the CI artifact upload (``if: failure()``) had nothing to upload —
exactly when the failure happened.

These tests mock just enough of the subprocess + filesystem surface
to drive the failure path without spinning up real Docker:

* ``subprocess.run`` is patched at the module level — the call for
  ``docker compose up`` returns a non-zero exit. Other calls (the
  ``logs`` / ``ps`` inside ``_dump_compose_diagnostics``) are
  swallowed by a default-OK return so the dump executes its inner
  body.
* ``shutil.which`` is patched to claim docker is on PATH (the lane
  short-circuits to ``skip`` otherwise).
* ``forge.generator.generate`` is patched to write a minimal
  ``docker-compose.yml`` into the tmp project root so the lane's
  existence check passes.
