"""Enforce RFC-006 (cross-backend fragment parity contract).

Each registered fragment must satisfy the tier/implementation contract:

- tier 1 ⇒ every built-in backend (Python, Node, Rust) has an impl.
- tier 3 ⇒ only Python has an impl.
- tier 2 ⇒ the residual (some subset, but not tier 1 or tier 3).

These invariants are asserted against the live ``FRAGMENT_REGISTRY``
so a PR that drops a backend from a tier-1 fragment, or promotes a
Python-only fragment without filling in the other backends, fails CI.

The tier is auto-derived in ``Fragment.__post_init__`` when unset, so
these tests mostly lock in the derivation. An author can override
``parity_tier`` explicitly (e.g. to flag a tier-2 migration target
that ships only Python today) — the override paths also flow through
here, so an inconsistent explicit label is caught too.
